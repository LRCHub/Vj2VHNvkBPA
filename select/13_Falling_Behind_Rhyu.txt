I feel like I'm falling behind
In this city where people are moving so fast
How long can one thing last
I ask
Let's rewind
I wanna pause in this moment
Do everything that I couldn't do
Cuz' I feel like I'm falling behind all of you
You're constantly 10 steps ahead
While I stay in the background and wither instead
Tell me what I should do
To be like you
Cuz I feel the weight when I'm sleeping
But when I wake don't know what to do
And I feel like I'm falling behind all of you
And if you asked me what life was about
I'd say it's not a race
But I can't help but measure our paces
I feel like I'm falling behind
In this city where people are moving so fast
How long can one thing last
I ask
Let's rewind
