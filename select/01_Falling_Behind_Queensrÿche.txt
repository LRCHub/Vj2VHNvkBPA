We are all equal but we're individually different
And able to reach the impossible if we try.

We find faith and strength in the most unlikely places
And love sometimes eludes us, but we try.
We keep searching and one day we find ...

Life goes on and around like a wheel
It keeps on turning, that's the deal.
Why are we running?
We're running so fast to keep from falling behind.
Problems come and they go and
In the end what will you show?
Why are we worried?
We worry so much, worry about falling behind.

Is it really all about the thing
Of what you wear and what you think I'll think?
Who has more?
Arabs and Jews at war, I don't care anymore.
It's always the same tired story.
How many dead in the name of some god?
And what's the difference?
Don't give a damn about their differences.
Nothing's sacred once the shooting starts .

Life goes on like a wheel,
It keeps on turning, that's for real.
Why are we running?
We're running so fast to keep from falling behind.
What may come and what may go
And in the end what will you show for all your worries?
Why worry so much, why worry about falling behind?

The plans already in motion,
It happens whether we say.
The old world order is over,
Intelligence and love win the day.
I won't regret one moment
Life is too short for that, bring it on.

Life goes on and around like a wheel,
It keeps on turning, that's the deal.
Why are we running?
We're running so fast to keep from falling behind.
Problems come and they go and
In the end what will you show?
Why are we worried?
Why worry so much? Don't worry about falling behind.
